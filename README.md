# Hygeia : A Social Platform for Mental Health

Hygeia is a social mental health platform where you can talk openly about how you are feeling. This platform is designed with anonimity as first priority as we know that it is for most of us not easy to talk about your own mental health. We want Hygeia to be the place that people feel comfortable talking about their struggles, read about people experiences, help others and have a great community feeling.
