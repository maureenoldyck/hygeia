# Hygeia : A Social Platform for Mental Health

Hygeia is a social mental health platform where you can talk openly about how you are <i>really</i> feeling. This platform is designed with anonimity as first priority as we know that it is, for most of us, not easy to talk about your own mental health. 

We want Hygeia to be the place that people feel comfortable talking about their struggles, read about people experiences, help others and have a great community feeling.

## Technology Used

For this project we chose to work with ReactJS in frontend and NodeJS in backend. During our preparation, we quickly decided to choose these languages because not only are they suitable for our project (a social platform that will need speed, handle a lot of data and functionality), also because we had a great interest in learning how to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.
### Frontend
* ReactJS - ^17.0.1 - Frontend library
* Tailwind CSS - ^2.0.3 - CSS framework
### Backend
* NodeJS - ^14.15.4 - Runtime environment for the server
* ExpressJS - ^4.17.1 - Framework to build our application
* mySQL - ^2.18.1 - Database

## Tools

* VSCode
