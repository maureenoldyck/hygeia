Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. People with severe mental health conditions die prematurely – as much as two decades early – due to preventable physical conditions.  \n\nDespite progress in some countries, people with mental health conditions often experience severe human rights violations, discrimination, and stigma. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet the gap between people needing care and those with access to care remains substantial. \n\nEffective treatment coverage remains extremely low. Increased investment is required on all fronts: for mental health awareness to increase understanding and reduce stigma; for efforts to increase access to quality mental health care and effective treatments; and for research to identify new treatments and improve existing treatments for all mental disorders. \n\nIn 2019, WHO launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019-2023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable care for mental health conditions in 12 priority countries to 100 million more people.  \n\nMental health conditions are increasing worldwide. Mainly because of demographic changes, there has been a 13% rise in mental health conditions and substance use disorders in the last decade (to 2017). Mental health conditions now cause 1 in 5 years lived with disability. Around 20% of the world’s children and adolescents have a mental health condition, with suicide the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. \n\nApproximately one in five people in post-conflict settings have a mental health condition. Mental health conditions can have a substantial effect on all areas of life, such as school or work performance, relationships with family and friends and ability to participate in the community. Two of the most common mental health conditions, depression and anxiety, cost the global economy US$ 1 trillion each year.

(2, 'A list of mental health problems', 'March 19, 20', 'verywellmind.com', 'A list of mental disorders', 'Mental disorders are patterns of behavioral or psychological symptoms that impact multiple areas of life. These disorders create distress for the person experiencing these symptoms. \n\nWhile not a comprehensive list of every mental disorder, the following list includes some of the major categories of disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The latest edition of the diagnostic manual is the DSM-5 and was released in May of 2013.﻿ The DSM is one of the most widely used systems for classifying mental disorders and provides standardized diagnostic criteria. \n\n1. Neurodevelopmental Disorders \n\nNeurodevelopmental disorders are those that are typically diagnosed during infancy, childhood, or adolescence. These psychological disorders include: \n\nIntellectual Disability \nSometimes called Intellectual Developmental Disorder, this diagnosis was formerly referred to as mental retardation. This type of developmental disorder originates prior to the age of 18 and is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors. Limitations to intellectual functioning are often identified through the use of IQ tests, with an IQ score under 70 often indicating the presence of a limitation. Adaptive behaviors are those that involve practical, everyday skills such as self-care, social interaction, and living skills. \n\nGlobal Developmental Delay \nThis diagnosis is for developmental disabilities in children who are under the age of five. Such delays relate to cognition, social functioning, speech, language, and motor skills. \nIt is generally seen as a temporary diagnosis applying to kids who are still too young to take standardized IQ tests. Once children reach the age where they are able to take a standardized intelligence test, they may be diagnosed with an intellectual disability. \n\nCommunication Disorders \nThese disorders are those that impact the ability to use, understand, or detect language and speech. The DSM-5 identifies four different subtypes of communication disorders: language disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood onset fluency disorder (stuttering), and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder \nThis disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social interaction and communication in multiple life areas as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors. The DSM specifies that symptoms of autism spectrum disorder must be present during the early developmental period and that these symptoms must cause significant impairment in important areas of life including social and occupational functioning. \\n\\n Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \\n ADHD is characterized by a persistent pattern of hyperactivity-impulsivity and/or inattention that interferes with functioning and presents itself in two or more settings such as at home, work, school, and social situations.  The DSM-5 specifies that several of the symptoms must have been present prior to the age of 12 and that these symptoms must have a negative impact on social, occupational, or academic functioning. \n\n2.

(3, 'How to recognize a mental disorder?', 'March 24, 21', 'Mayo Clinic', 'Signs and symptoms', 'Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors. \n\nExamples of signs and symptoms include: \n\n- Feeling sad or down\n- Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate \n- Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guilt \n- Extreme mood changes of highs and lows \n- Withdrawal from friends and activities \n- Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping \n- Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations \n- Inability to cope with daily problems or stress \n- Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people \n- Problems with alcohol or drug use \n- Major changes in eating habits \n- Sex drive changes \n- Excessive anger, hostility or violence \n- Suicidal thinking\n\nSometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains. \n\nWhen to see a doctor? \nIf you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Most mental illnesses don\'t improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems.\n', 'how-to-recognize', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org', 'whatis'),
(4, 'Can my mental disorder go away?', 'March 24, 21', 'Mental Health Foundation', 'Is it possible to recover?', 'In mental health, recovery may not always refer to the process of complete recovery from a mental health problem in the way that we might recover from a physical health problem. \n\nRecovery can mean different things to different people, however, for many, recovery is about the realisation of goals, and the development of relationships and skills that support a positive life, with or without ongoing mental health problems.\n\nOverview of Recovery\n\nWhile there is no universally accepted definition of recovery, one definition, often referred to as the “recovery model” argues for the importance of building the resilience of people with mental health problems and supporting their identity and self-esteem. It is a strength-based approach that does not focus solely on symptoms and which emphasises resilience and control over life’s challenges. This model aims to help people with mental health problems move forward, set new goals, and take part in relationships and activities that are meaningful.\n\nRecovery is also often referred to as a process, and some of the important features of this recovery process can be described by the acronym “CHIME”, which stands for: Connectedness, Hope and Optimism, Identity, Meaning and Purpose, and Empowerment \n\nRecovery & Mental Health\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that self-management strategies based on the recovery model may have more value than models based on physical health alone1. Some research suggests that important factors on the road to recovery include:\n- Good relationships\n- Satisfying work\n- Personal growth\n- The right living environment\n\nA recovery approach is becoming adopted into the delivery and design of many mental health services. Implementation of recovery‐oriented practice should involve person‐centred care and recognition that recovery in not necessarily about cure. The focus is on supporting individuals to live meaningful, satisfying, and purposeful lives.\n\nAs there is a strong link between the recovery process and social inclusion (i.e. being involved with society through work, education, culture, and leisure activities), a key role for services is to support people to regain their place in the communities in which they live and enable participation in activities and opportunities.Therefore, the recovery journey benefits from a well-organized system of support which involves the individual themselves, family, friends, professionals, health services, and wider communities.\n\n', 'can-it-go-away', 'https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk', 'recovery'),
(5, 'How to look after your mental health', 'March 24, 21', 'Mental Health Foundation', 'What can you do?', 'It’s important to take care of yourself and get the most from life. Below are 10 practical ways to look after your mental health. Making simple changes to how you live doesn’t need to cost a fortune or take up loads of time. Anyone can follow this advice. Why not start today? \n\n1. Talk about your feelings \nTalking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled. \n\n2. Keep active \nRegular exercise can boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and feel better. Exercise keeps the brain and your other vital organs healthy, and is also a significant benefit towards improving your mental health. \n\n3. Eat well\nYour brain needs a mix of nutrients in order to stay healthy and function well, just like the other organs in your body. A diet that’s good for your physical health is also good for your mental health.\n\n4. Drink sensibly\nWe often drink alcohol to change our mood. Some people drink to deal with fear or loneliness, but the effect is only temporary. When the drink wears off, you feel worse because of the way the alcohol has affected your brain and the rest of your body. Drinking is not a good way to manage difficult feelings. \n\n5. Keep in touch\nThere’s nothing better than catching up with someone face to face, but that’s not always possible. You can also give them a call, drop them a note, or chat to them online instead. Keep the lines of communication open: it’s good for you!\n\n6. Ask for help\nNone of us are superhuman. We all sometimes get tired or overwhelmed by how we feel or when things don’t go to plan.\nIf things are getting too much for you and you feel you can’t cope, ask for help. Your family or friends may be able to offer practical help or a listening ear. Local services are there to help you. \n\n7. Take a break\nA change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health.\nIt could be a five-minute pause from cleaning your kitchen, a half-hour lunch break at work, or a weekend exploring somewhere new. A few minutes can be enough to de-stress you. Give yourself some “me time”.\n\n8. Do something you’re good at \\n What do you love doing? What activities can you lose yourself in? What did you love doing in the past?\n\nEnjoying yourself can help beat stress. Doing an activity you enjoy probably means you’re good at it, and achieving something boosts your self-esteem.\n\n9. Accept who you are \nWe’re all different. It’s much healthier to accept that you’re unique than to wish you were more like someone else. Feeling good about yourself boosts your confidence to learn new skills, visit new places and make new friends. Good self-esteem helps you cope when life takes a difficult turn.\n\n10. Care for others\nCaring for others is often an important part of keeping up relationships with people close to you. It can even bring you closer together.', 'what-can-i-do', 'https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk', 'recovery'),
(6, 'Professional Help', 'March 24, 21', 'Mental Health America', 'Get Professional Help If You Need It', 'If the problems in your life are stopping you from functioning well or feeling good, professional help can make a big difference. And if you\'re having trouble, know that you are not alone: One in four adults in this country have a mental health problem in any given year. \n\nIf you or someone you know is feeling especially bad or suicidal, get help right away. \n\nOf course, you don\'t have to be in crisis to seek help. Why wait until you\'re really suffering? Even if you\'re not sure that you\'d benefit from help, it can\'t hurt to explore the possibility.  \n\nA mental health professional can help you:  \n\n- Come up with plans for solving problems  \n- Feel stronger in the face of challenges  \n- Change behaviors that hold you back  \n- Look at ways of thinking that affect how you feel  \n- Heal pains from your past  \n- Figure out your goals  \n- Build self-confidence \n\nMost people who seek help feel better. For example, more than 80 percent of people treated for depression improve. Treatment for panic disorders has up to a 90 percent success rate. Treatment for a mental health issue can include medication and psychotherapy. In some cases, the two work well together. \n\nWhat, exactly, is psychotherapy? It\'s a general term that means talking about your problems with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes. Depending on your situation, treatment can be fairly short or longer-term. \n\nSome people worry that getting help is a sign of weakness. If you do, consider that it can be a sign of great strength to take steps toward getting your life back on track. \n\nFinding Help \n- Get names of mental health professionals from your doctor, friend,.. If your workplace has an employee assistance program, it also can provide help.  \n- Interview more than one professional before choosing, if possible. You\'ll want to feel comfortable with the person.\n- You can see a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, pastoral counselor or other type of mental health professional. Of these, only a psychiatrist can prescribe medication.  \n- Sometimes, your health insurance company will cover only certain types of providers, so check how your plan works.\n', 'professional-help', 'https://www.mhanational.org', 'help'),
(7, 'Help From Friends', 'March 24, 21', 'Mental Health Foundation', 'Friendship and mental health', 'Our friendships are among the most valuable relationships we have. We gain in various ways from different friendships. We may talk to friends in confidence about things we wouldn\'t discuss with our families. Our friends may annoy us, but they can also keep us going. \n\nFriendship is a crucial element in protecting our mental health. We need to talk to our friends and we want to listen when our friends want to talk to us. Our friends can keep us grounded and can help us get things in perspective. It is worth putting effort into maintaining our friendships and making new friends. Friends form one of the foundations of our ability to cope with the problems that life throws at us. \n\n\'The best thing my friend did for me was that they just accepted me as I was.\' \n\n\'They kept coming to see me even though I didn\'t seem to want them and they made me laugh.\' \n\n\nWhy is friendship important when someone is unwell? \nWhen someone has a mental health problem or is experiencing mental distress, it is important to try to keep friendships going, even though people with mental health problems often want to see their friends less than usual. \n\nFriendship can play a key role in helping someone live with or recover from a mental health problem and overcome the isolation that often comes with it. It\'s natural to worry when a friend is troubled and most of us don\'t want to give up on a friend in distress, however difficult it may be to support them. Many people who do manage to keep their friendship going feel that it\'s stronger as a result. \n\nFriendships work both ways. A mental health problem doesn\'t mean that you\'re never able to support or laugh with someone else. \n\n\'My friend helped me to get a grip on myself by making it clear it wasn\'t acceptable or safe for me to allow my condition to dominate my life.\' \n\nHow does mental ill health affect friendships?\n- People with more severe forms of mental illness have smaller social networks than others and have more family members than friends in their social circle. \n- People with smaller social networks, with fewer intimate relationships, find it more difficult to manage social situations.  \n- People with more long-lasting mental health problems often have relationships mainly with other people with mental health problems.  \n- People with mental health problems often anticipate rejection from other people because of the stigma associated with mental health. They may avoid social contact, as a form of \'self-stigma\'.  \n\nHow can friendships change? \n\n\'She has just been diagnosed as being bi-polar. When she drinks she gets very upset and angry so we rarely invite her to join us when alcohol is involved. I also make more of an effort to listen.\' \n\nFriendships change and sometimes they fade away or end abruptly. You may want to take time to reflect on each of your friendships and what they offer you. \n\nYou are an active partner in your friendships. If a friendship is not beneficial to both of you, you have the power to negotiate changes to the activities you have always done together. On some occasions, you may decide that it\'s best for a friendship to end. \n\nIf a friend no longer contacts you, it\'s understandable to feel rejected, but you are not responsible for other people\'s reaction to your problems. If one person ends your friendship, it doesn\'t mean that others will do the same. \n\nIf you are the friend of someone experiencing mental health problems who seems to be withdrawing from your friendship, try to understand what your friend may be going through. Their difficulties may be only temporary. Give them the space they need and make sure they know how they can contact you at a later date if they decide to get back in touch.  \n\nShould I tell my friend about my problem? \nSome people never make it past the first hurdle: talking about the fact that they are experiencing mental distress. If you have a mental health problem, you may feel ashamed of \'admitting\' to it. You may feel that you are bothering your friend or fear being labelled.  \n\nYou don\'t have to tell your friends - and you certainly don\'t have to tell everyone. There is no need to tell anyone about what you are experiencing if you don\'t feel comfortable with it. Some people find it helpful to draw up a balance sheet of the pros and cons of telling or not telling people about their problem. \n\nTough as it can be, talking to close friends can be important for both of you. Even if you don\'t talk about it again, having the issue out in the open means that you don\'t have to worry about mentioning it by accident or \'explain away\' medication or appointments. It may also make clear why you may be behaving in a particular way or why you don\'t want to go out or talk to them much. \n\n\'I wanted my friends to know so they...would cut me some slack if I behaved oddly...don\'t think I\'m just ignoring them...could help me.\'\n\nHow do I tell my friend? \nPick a friend you trust as the first person you tell. Work out how to talk about your mental health problem in a way that will make it as easy as possible for both of you to avoid embarrassment. \n\nYou may want to practise your opening sentence or you may want to play it by ear. Choose a time and a place where you will both feel comfortable. You may want to think about whether: \n- The place is quiet or noisy, indoors or outside  \n- You are on your own or among other people, for instance in a pub or cafe \n- You are doing an activity together, such as going for a walk, or just sitting down for a chat.\n- You could phone or write to your friend, but if you do, try and talk to them face to face afterwards as well. \n\nSome people react dramatically to news like this. Be ready for your friend to be shocked or not to take it in at first. Although mental health problems are common, this may be the first time they\'ve heard someone talk about having one. \n\nThey may feel awkward and not know how to respond. This may be because they feel so worried about you or perhaps your news has struck a chord with something in their own life. They may even suggest that you\'re fine and just need to \'pull yourself together\'. \n\nMost people don\'t know very much about mental health issues so it may be a good idea to tell your friend about the problem itself, but don\'t overwhelm them. Take it one step at a time. \n\nHow should I respond to hearing about my friend\'s problem? \nIf you\'re the friend of someone with a mental health problem, you may be concerned about them. The most important thing is to tell them that you\'re still their friend. If your friend is comfortable with being touched, a hug shows that you care about them and that you accept them whatever problems they are having. \n\n\'My friend asked me questions, didn\'t just assume things, she really wanted to know.\' \n\nTake your cue from your friend. Are they comfortable with questions or would they rather talk about something else? Don\'t promise things you may not be able to deliver. How can you help them best? \n\nHow can I support my friend? \nPeople with mental health problems often need different things from their friends at different times and friends show their support in different ways. \nIf you\'re the friend, the most valuable support you can provide is just being there to talk and listen. People really appreciate that their friends have made time to contact them, visit them and invite them round.\nMental health problems are so misunderstood that someone who acknowledges your problem, continues to accept you and treats you with compassion is doing something extremely important to aid your recovery. \n\n\'My friend phoned me, talked to me about normal stuff, sent me letters, took me out sometimes.\' \n\n Your friend isn\'t looking for another mental health professional and should expect nothing more than your affection and your support as a friend. Some people with mental health problems want to go on being as \'normal\' as possible with their friends and that may mean continuing to laugh and have fun together. They don\'t want to be identified by their problem, even if you need to adapt some of the activities you used to do together. \n\n\'I didn\'t know how often to ask \'how she was\' (especially in front of other people).\' \n\nHowever, someone who insists that they\'re \'fine\' may actually be in a pretty bad way. They may just need to talk or they may need professional help. Men are often particularly reluctant to talk about emotional issues.  \n\nPractical help can be valuable, too. Cleaning, shopping and basic household tasks can seem impossible to someone who is having a difficult time. Many people really appreciate friends who help them manage their finances or take them to appointments - or indeed just take them out. Another form of practical help is by tracking down information - for example about therapies, organisations and services. \n\nIf you feel more comfortable offering practical help than emotional support, explain this to your friend. It is important that you acknowledge their distress, even if you don\'t talk about it much. \n\nUnderstanding your limits \nIf you\'re miserable, suicidal, confused or having mood swings, you\'re not likely to be your \'usual self\'. It\'s intensely frustrating - for you, and for everyone around you - to realise that you don\'t feel up to doing the things you used to take for granted such as going to work, seeing your friends, getting exercise or playing with your children. \n\nIf you can\'t go out - or you can\'t get out of bed - you become increasingly isolated and perhaps hard to be with.  And if you show other symptoms like hearing voices or you\'re convinced that someone is doing you down, it\'s hard for you to talk to other people and it\'s very hard for them to talk to you.  \n\n\'I gave my friend a lot of support and at times felt close to burning out. Now that my friend has recovered we are closer than before. However, I worry that I might not be able to cope with another episode.\'\n\nFriends who do hang on in there can feel out of their depth, frustrated or emotionally drained. You may feel that the person you used to know has changed and so has the balance of who needs whom in the friendship. \n\nSome people reach the point where, instead of being a friend, they feel they\'ve become more of a carer. You may feel responsible for your friend and worry about what would happen if you weren\'t around. It can be painful and embarrassing - on both sides - to admit that this is happening and it can be hard to get the balance back, even if your friend\'s mental health improves. But you don\'t need to cope alone and setting clear limits to the support you can give is not the same as rejecting your friend.  \n\nMental Health First Aid \n\nThese are five steps that research shows can help people with mental health problems: \n- Assess risk of suicide or self-harm \n- Listen non-judgmentally  \n- Give reassurance and information  \n- Encourage the person to get appropriate professional help   \n- Encourage self-help strategies.  \n\nOthers sources of support  \nIf you have a mental health problem and you\'re worried that you\'re making too many demands on your friend, one of the most important things you can do is thank them. Make it clear - in words or actions - that you appreciate what they are doing for you. \n\nYour friendship may change for a while or it may change permanently. However, it doesn\'t have to vanish. Nor does it have to take over your life. Underneath everything that is going on, you\'re still the people who became friends in the first place. We all have our ups and downs and need the support of our friends. \n\nFriendship is worth sticking with\nIf you don\'t want to turn to your friends, or your friends just don\'t want to listen or you want to take some of the pressure off them, there are other forms of informal help.\nSelf-help and peer support groups are often useful. You may have little in common with everyone else in the room, but you will share one thing.  \nYou could join a group centred around an activity: a book group, a chess club or an exercise class.\n\nIf you don\'t want to join a group, try going to places where there are lots of people. You could go to your local library. Leisure centres usually have cafés. You don\'t have to talk to other people if you don\'t want to, but will be in company while you sit with a drink and a newspaper for a while. \n\nIf you\'ve got internet access, online communities can also be supportive, whether or not they are focused around mental health problems. It can be reassuring to know that this is an arena where nobody knows anything about your personal life.\n', 'help-from-friends', 'https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk', 'help'),

There are home workouts personal trainers are doing for free on Instagram, or try out a YouTube workout video a few times a week. Or, you can go for a daily walk to get some fresh air and move your limbs.\n\n2) Try a relaxation technique \nRelaxing and focusing on your breathing can help to alleviate tension and lighten negative emotions.\nTry to evaluate your body during the day. Are your shoulders lifted? Is your jaw tense? If you recognise that you’re stiffening your body, take deep breaths to ease the tension and relax your muscles.  \n\n3) Connect with others\\n Staying at home, especially if you live alone, or with household members you aren’t close with, can feel lonely. Find time to keep in touch with co-workers, friends, family, and others to help you (and them) feel more connected.\nExplore ways of connecting that work for you. This could include video-calling, WhatsApp, written notes or social media. \n\n4) Take time to reflect and practice self-compassion \nMake time every day to reflect on the positive aspects of your day. Whether you managed to get out of bed, or you completed an important task, celebrate the small things. Consider keeping a gratitude journal each day where you could write two or three things you are grateful for each day.\nMindfulness techniques may also help you focus on the present rather than dwelling on unhelpful thoughts (thought they may not be helpful for those experiencing social anxiety or more severe depression). \n\n5) Improve your sleep\nWith continuous last-minute changes to the rules, and now another lockdown, you may be experiencing trouble sleeping.\n\nThere are many ways you can help improve your sleep. Aim to go to bed and get up at the same time each day in order to maintain a routine. Also, try to get some natural sunlight by opening curtains and windows. This helps to regulate your body clock which can help you sleep better. Before bedtime, avoid using your phone, tablet or computer. Instead, try to read a book, or do some yoga.\n', 'at-home', 'https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk', 'help');
